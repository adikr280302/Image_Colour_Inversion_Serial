# Image Colour Inversion

## Serial Implementation

This program will help you to invert the colors of your image.
It inverts every bit in every element of the image in the 1st parameter and places the result in the image in the 2nd parameter. This function can process images in place. 

Inverting an image means inverting the pixel values. From a visual perspective, when we invert a binary image, white pixels will be converted to black, and black pixels will be converted to white.
